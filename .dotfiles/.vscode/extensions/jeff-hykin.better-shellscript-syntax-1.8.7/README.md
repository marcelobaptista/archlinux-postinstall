# What does this do?
This will get you the bleeding-edge syntax highlighting for bash/zsh. Which means your theme will be able to color your code better.

NOTE: The default VS Code theme does not color much. Switch to the Dark+ theme (installed by default) or use a theme like one of the following to benefit from the changes:
- [XD Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeff-hykin.xd-theme)
- [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis)
- [Kary Pro Colors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karyfoundation.theme-karyfoundation-themes)
- [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)
- [One Monokai Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.one-monokai)
- [Winteriscoming](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.winteriscoming)
- [Popping and Locking](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hedinne.popping-and-locking-vscode)
- [Syntax Highlight Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=peaceshi.syntax-highlight)
- [Default Theme Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-themes)

## How do I use it?
